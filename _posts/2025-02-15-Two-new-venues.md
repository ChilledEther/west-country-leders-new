## __Two new regular venues for WCL members!__

We're excited to announce two new regular meet up events for the end of every month!

On the 4th Saturday of the month, we'll be heading to Replay games bar on Cheltenham Road, where WCl members can play for Â£1/hour between 6pm-11pm!
And then on every 4th Sunday, we'll be at Exclesior Games in Broadmead between 11am-5pm to play some Sunday afternoon games! This will also be a great opportunity for anybody who has an interest in games design, to come along and share you own ideas for board games, and work alongside other enthusiasts!

As always, if you are interested in attending any of our events, please let us know via our [Discord!](https://discord.gg/JuuxmmbgG7)
