# __The woodland is at war...again!__ 
## ‚ú® __Sign up announcement__ ‚ú® 

*The woodland is filled with danger and chaos. The denizens fought tirelessly over petty squabbles, forming paths and clearings as the infighting continued. Once these settlements had been established, it would only be a matter of time before a greater power took an interest in the woodland for themselves. Countless factions have claimed dominance over the woodland, yet not one of these claims are yet to be true. It only seems as the war goes on, the more opportunistic denizens become. Today multiple factions vie for control of the woodland, as the inhabitants demand peace. Will you be the one to seize control and put an end to the eternal war?*

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Root is a game of asymmetry and war for 2-5 people battling for control of the woodland. Players will partake in the action by choosing from a myriad of animal factions to drive the narrative to its inevitable conclusion. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, leading to a vast level of asymmetric interaction.

**West country leaders are proud to be hosting their 5th Root tournament in Bristol on Saturday May 10th!**

Aspiring players can expect a day full of fun and treachery as the fight for the right to claim sovereignty over the woodland. Players will play games in pods of 4 using the newly introduced ADSET system and draft the factions they will play in each game. Unfortunately there can be only one ruler, meaning there can only be one winner! However even if you lose your first game, there will still be everything to fight for in a second game, followed by a four player final (plus losers bracket finals)!

Further tournament rules will be added closer to the date as there may be some changes from previous tournaments. So please stay tuned for further information.
