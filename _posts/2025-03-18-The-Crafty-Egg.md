We have had The Crafty Egg cafe on Church Road reach out to us, to ask if we would like to run a regular games night. 
Starting from Wednesday 26th, we will be at The Crafty Egg from 6:30-10pm every fortnight!

We will have the front of the cafe reserved for our group, and I have been told that we can move around the tables, and adjust lighting/music to suit our needs!

There should be space for up to about 30 of us should that many of you be interested!
As always with new venues, we'll give it a trial period to see how well it works for us, so do make the most of it if you'd like to see more midweek events in East Bristol!

There are a number of Egg locations, so be sure to come to the one in Redfield!
