Starting in 2025, WCL are making October our annual charity drive! Every October, we'll be encouraging WCL members to throw a few quid toward a chosen charity with the aim of raising funds for some local organisations. 
This year, we chose to raise money for *Bristol Mind*, a brilliant local branch of the national mental health organisation.
They promote wellbeing and recovery through a range of services, including their MindLine helplines, Hate Crime service, counselling, and training.

We're very happy to announce that our grand total for funds raised for Bristol Mind is **£622!**

Huge thank you to everyone who made a donation, we blew straight past our goal of £200!

We'll be running another charity drive in October 2026 :)
