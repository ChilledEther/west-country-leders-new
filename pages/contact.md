West Country Leders is ran by a group of individuals (not for profit).

The main way to communicate with club memebers is via our [Discord server]([resentatio](https://discord.gg/JuuxmmbgG7))
Using @mods in any channel will alert the leadership team.

Alternatively, you can email: <a href="mailto:westcountryleders@gmail.com">westcountryleders@gmail.com</a>

Or feel free to just pop by any of our ]regular events](link to the venues page)
