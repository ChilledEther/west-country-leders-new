## __West Country Leders__
West Country Leders are a Bristol based board game community. We are friendly and welcoming to people both new to the hobby and those who have been gaming for their entire life.
What started off as a small group of us meeting up to play [Root](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root), has now grown in a club with over 700 members that runs events every single week to play a really diverse range of board games.

What you can expect from WCL:
- Board gaming events organised every single week across Bristol.
- A friendly and inclusive club to make new friends.
- Teaching sessions for any board games you would like to learn.
- Regular competitive tournaments for our most played games (Root, Twilight Imperium, Arcs + more to come!)
- Online gaming via Board Game Arena, TTS, Steam, and Consoles.
- Regular non-board game trips to watch films, go on walks, and take photographs.

If you love to play board games, or would like to enter into the hobby and be part of a welcoming group of enthusiasts, why not [join our Discord today](https://discord.gg/JuuxmmbgG7)!

We are always improving as a club, and so if you have any suggestions on how we can improve, weâ€™d love to hear from you on westcountryleders@gmail.
