What started off as a small group of us meeting up to play [Root](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root), has now grown in a club with over 700 members that runs events every single week to play a really diverse range of board games.

What you can expect from WCL:
- Organised board game events every single week.
- A friendly and inclusive club to make new friends.
- Regular competitive tournaments for our most played games.
- Online gaming via Board Game Arena, TTS, Steam, and Consoles.
