## __West Country Leders__
West Country Leders are a Bristol based board game community. We are friendly and welcoming to people both new to the hobby and those who have been gaming for their entire life.
What started off as a small group of us meeting up to play [Root](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root), has now grown in a club with over 700 members that runs events every single week to play a really diverse range of board games.

What you can expect from WCL:
- Board game events, organised every single week.
- A friendly and inclusive club to make new friends.
- Regular competitive tournaments for our most played games.
- Online gaming via Board Game Arena, TTS, Steam, and Consoles.
- Regular non-board game trips to watch films, go on walks, and take photographs.
